# PennyMac-Code-Test
Contains python solution files for the PennyMac code test.

Question #1:
In the attached file (w_data.dat), you’ll find daily weather data.   Download this text file, then write a program to output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third column).
- PennyMac_q1.py contains a python solution for Question #1 of the code test.

Question #2:
The attached soccer.dat file contains the results from the English Premier League.  The columns labeled ‘F’ and ‘A’ contain the total number of goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents, and had 36 goals scored against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.
- PennyMac_q2.py contains a python solution for Question #2 of the code test.

Question #3:
Is the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?
- Though the requirements are slightly different for each problem, I was able to re-use some of the logic (finding the difference between two row values, sorting by the added column to identify the smallest value) from the first solution in the second solution.
